                I realized I needed proper basketball shoes after playing a game of pick-up where I couldn't last beyond a single 11-point game. I had been wearing old Reeboks that weren't made for basketball, and by the end of the game, I could barely feel my feet. The lack of cushioning and support left me struggling to keep up, and that's when it hit me: I needed shoes that were actually designed for the sport.
